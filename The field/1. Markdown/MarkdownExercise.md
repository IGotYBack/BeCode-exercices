# Nadège - [In a webdev formation](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nad%C3%A8ge-hombergen-baa124171/)

## **Who am I ?**

I wish I was a unicorn but I happend to be a human being.

As every humain, I make mistakes but I try to learn from each one of them. When I was confronted to a end game situation with my previous job, I analyzed why I was there at that time and what I could do to avoid that situation again.

From there I noticed that I didn't want to be a social worker anymore, or at least not as it was before my sick leave.

On the side of my work I was already streaming a bit and for the sake of the stream, I had to put my hands in CSS and HTML. I noticed that I enjoyed it a lot and that it kept me occupied. So while I was on sick leave, I started to learn it a bit more seriously on my own.

And that how I was born. Well ... That I ended up here at least, writting something making nonsens for a formation which, I wish, can help me reach my goal.

Whatev' I wish I was a unicorn.

## **Some randoms Skills ?**

Life is full of surprises

- I can count two by two
- I can tie my laces
- Except that I'm a unicorn _(a turttle if you want the real reference)_ and that I don't have any shoes.

> - Once upon a time I was part of the Belgian national team of Ultimate Frisbee so I can throw discs with a relative precision **take care of your nose ;)**. I can be part of a huge team, apply what is asked and bring a bit of energy when needed.
> - Then I had to stop playing for medical reason. But I love Ultimate so much and coaching is one of the thing I always enjoyed to do. So it kind of means that I'm able to manage a group, I guess ?
> - Even though I appear a bit shy and I mostly stay on my corner when I don't know the peoples surrounding me, some persons call me the King's fool. Which should mean that I'm funny in a sort of way ?

## **I liiiike ...**

I kind of like coding but I really prefer to do so in HTML, CSS and JS than in Markdown or in the terminal. It's nice to get to know what exist (for Markdown) and what is the Terminal but it's too impresonnal. Which lead me to :

I guess that I really love beautifull things and to be able to create them.

I also love to stream and all of the people that pass by and share even small parts of their lives. It's really empowerring on one hand and people have so much to give and teach without even noticing it.

## **With BeCode**

I'd love to get better at what I'm already doing, learn new skills and get the help needed when it's getting too hard.
I also wish to acquire some confidance in what I'm doing because I've the feeling that everything I do is quite OK, it does work but it could be way much more efficient.

### **And that doesn't come without any fear**

In fact, I had a well paied job in a CDI contract. Even thought it was making me a bit miserable in life because I didn't liked it anymore, it was secure. Everything was set so I could have a comfortable life..

Now I'm operating a 360° degree and it's making me nervous not knowing what tomorrow is going to look like. Am I going to like to work as a webdev ? In fact I'm afraid that there's a huge gape between liking to code for fun and doing it to eat.

But I'm sure that pleasure and work can still be bound if we find what makes us really happy.

## **Work as a team**

Even thought I know how to work as a team because I've already work on a lot of team's projects for y previous job and played a team sport for years, there's one thing I'm aware of being bad at while in team :

I'm super demanding with myself and I often expect people to be as demanding as I am. I doesn't mean that I except peoples to be the best, but at least that they give 100% of their capacities and not just what they want.

Sometimes it's a bit hard and I'm working on myself on that side. But it's really hard for me to see someone say "I'm gonna take that in charge" and not doing it which makes the whole group lose time.
